    <p><b>Build Genome Set from Feature Set</b> allows a user to extract Genomes from a FeatureSet and make a GenomeSet object from them. The features themselves in a FeatureSet object contain the information about which genomes they are associated with, so this information is extracted to form the output GenomeSet.</p>
